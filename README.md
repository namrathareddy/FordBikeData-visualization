The dataset used for this project is the usage of Bikes in US across major cities for the year of 2017 that was provided by Udacity. By analyzing the data, I was able to understand the trends of usage by age group and gender. I also analysed the  how the trends vary based on hour of the day, day of the week and month of the year. This will better help the bike sharing company to better stock the bikes based on the hour, day and month.</p>
